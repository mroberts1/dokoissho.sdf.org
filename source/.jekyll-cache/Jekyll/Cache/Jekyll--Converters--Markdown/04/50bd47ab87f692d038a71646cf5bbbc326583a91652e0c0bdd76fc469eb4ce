I"4<p>Sometimes an XFCE panel will stop responding to mouse clicks. Itâ€™s frustrating
to have to logout or restart just to get it working again.</p>

<p>Running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xfce4-panel -r</code> from the terminal will restart all XFCE panels and fix
any frozen ones.</p>
