I"]<p><strong>beter-api</strong> is an Emacs library for working with the Bter API. Bter.com was a
Bitcoin and crypto-currency exchange platform.</p>

<p><strong>bter.com has closed, so this library is no longer functional</strong></p>

<p>Itâ€™s not a particularly useful extension on its own, but can be used to build
something more interesting.</p>
