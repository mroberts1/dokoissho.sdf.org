I"<p>Even though I’ve used BlitzMax for years, I only just realized that it doesn’t
care about case when it comes to variables. I knew that local and global
variables didn’t matter, but constant names are also case-insensitive.</p>

<p>For example, the following will output “ONE”:</p>

<pre><code class="language-blitzmax">Const my_constant:Int = 1

If MY_CONSTANT = 1 Then Print "ONE"
</code></pre>

<p>The same result occurs even in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SuperStrict</code> mode.</p>
