<p>Although Emacs is my primary editor 99% of the time, I still use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code> when I
need to edit something quickly (and especially if I need root priveleges).</p>

<p>I recently found out about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/zile/">zile</a>, an
extremely lightweight editor that uses Emacs key-bindings and has a similar
buffer mode.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not a replacement for Emacs, but it does support scripting and is a decent
alternative to nano.</p>
