I"Ó<p><a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit">Paredit</a> is an Emacs extension for
working with parenthesis and S-expressions.</p>

<p>From the ParEdit page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ParEdit (paredit.el) is a minor mode for performing structured editing of
S-expression data. The typical example of this would be Lisp or Scheme source
code.</p>

  <p>ParEdit helps <strong>keep parentheses balanced</strong> and adds many keys for moving
S-expressions and moving around in S-expressions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seeing it in action makes it much clearer how useful it is. Hereâ€™s two great
visual guides to ParEdit and what it can do:</p>

<p>Like most things Emacs, it takes a while to get used to. But once over the initial
learning curve itâ€™s indespensible.</p>
