I"â<p>I have a few pages online that I want to be protected, but ocassionally I might
pass out a link to share. I didnâ€™t really like having to remember a password, so
I set up an IP whitelist. Anybody not on the list is denied.</p>

<p>The problem is that I need to update the IP whitelist when someone new wants
access, which isnâ€™t always practical.</p>

<p>This solution will check for a whitelisted IP first. If that fails, it will
prompt for a username and password.</p>
