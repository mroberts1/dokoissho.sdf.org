I"<p>I use the <a href="https://xfce.org/">xfce</a> for my desktop environment. Recently I’ve
been trying to fix all of the little things that bug me but aren’t really
important. I wanted the xfce calendar to start weeks on Monday rather than
Sunday.</p>

<p>Adding the following to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/default/locale</code> did the trick:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>LC_TIME="en_GB.UTF-8"
</code></pre></div></div>
