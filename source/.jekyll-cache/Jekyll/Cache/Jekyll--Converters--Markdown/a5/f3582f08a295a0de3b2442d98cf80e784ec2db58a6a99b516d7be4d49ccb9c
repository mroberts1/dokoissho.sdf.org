I"Ê<p>MaxCop is a simple command-line tool for finding BlitzMax formatting
issues. Itâ€™s similar to tools like <a href="https://www.rubocop.org/">RuboCop</a>, but not
as good.</p>

<p>It can currently scan for 15 different rule violations, mostly around Type
sizing and member names. Eventually Iâ€™d like to integrate it into Emacs so code
issues can be underlined.</p>
