I"ˆ<p>I started writing this at the end of 2018 to learn a little more about 6502
machine code and how it all fits together. I never got around to finishing it,
so set it as a goal for 2019.</p>

<p>The following code (once assembled) runs correctlyâ€¦</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>loop: LDA $FE
      STA $00
      LDA $FE
      AND #$3
      CLC
      ADC #$2
      STA $01
      LDA $FE
      LDY #$0
      STA ($00),Y
      JMP LOOP
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>..and produces this wonderful screen:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/6502-max.png" alt="6502-max" class="centered" /></p>

<p>It still needs unit testing thoroughly, mostly to check various flags work
correctly, but itâ€™s functional enough for now. Eventually Iâ€™d like to add some
debugging commands for stepping through functions and examining memory.</p>
