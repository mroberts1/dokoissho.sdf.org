I"q<p><strong>Apollo</strong> is an entity/component framework for ActionScript. Instead of building
your game objects from class heirarchies, Apollo lets you build them with
components and systems.</p>

<p>I was too lazy to write an examples when it was first released. Lesson learned.</p>

<p>It’s not a replacement for things like Flixel or Flashpunk. They take care of
the stuff people see, Apollo does the “behind the scenes”.</p>

<p>Entity systems are a big topic. The following places have lots of information on
them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/">Entity Systems Wiki</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://t-machine.org">Adam Martin’s Blog</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://paulgestwicki.blogspot.com/2012/03/components-and-systems-of-morgans-raid.html">The Components and Systems of Morgan’s Raid</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Want some examples? Here are some open source projects (mostly written with
Artemis) that you can learn from:</p>

<p>Apollo is based on the Artemis framework by <a href="http://gamadu.com">Gamadu</a>, along
with improvements made by <a href="https://github.com/gemserk/artemis">GemSerk</a>.</p>
